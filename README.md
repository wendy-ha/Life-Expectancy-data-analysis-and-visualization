## Introduction
Despite the fact that many research have been conducted in the past on factors impacting life expectancy, including demographic characteristics, income composition, and mortality rates, Max Roser emphasized on Our World In Data that the influence of vaccines has been overlooked (Max et al 2013).
<br/>
<br/>
Share the same concern with Max, two researchers from World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Data and Analytics, Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang, have compiled a collection of statistics on the key drivers of life expectancy, with a focus on immunization variables including Hepatitis B, Measles, Polio, and Diphtheria (Deeksha and Duan 2015). Furthermore, mortality, economy, social issues, and other health- related aspects are all taken into consideration (Deeksha and Duan 2015). As a result, numerous analyses of the impact of vaccination on human lifespans in developed and developing nations have been undertaken using this data set, with the goal of assisting residents in those countries in improving their quality of life.
### Objective
The analysis tries to answer the following essential questions:
- Among four main categories: vaccination-related factors, mortality-related factors, economic factors, and social factors, what are the actual factors
influencing life expectancy?
- What effect does immunisation coverage have on life expectancy?
- What effect do schooling and alcohol have on life expectancy?
- What effect does GDP have on life expectancy?
